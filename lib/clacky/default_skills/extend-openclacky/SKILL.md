name: extend-openclacky
description: Customize, fix, override or extend openclacky itself — e.g. change a built-in tool's behavior, intercept/audit/block tool calls with shell scripts, or plug in a new IM channel (Slack, in-house IM, etc.). Trigger on phrases like "patch clacky", "patch openclacky", "change WebSearch behavior", "block dangerous commands", "audit tool use", "add Slack channel", "改 openclacky 内置", "改 clacky 内置", "monkey patch openclacky", "拦截工具调用". Do NOT trigger for ordinary feature work in the user's own project that doesn't touch openclacky.

# Extending Openclacky

Openclacky ships three official extension mechanisms that survive `gem update` and never require editing the gem source.
**Never tell the user to `bundle show openclacky` and edit the gem — always use one of these.**

## Pick the right mechanism

| User wants to… | Use | Scaffold | Verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| Change behavior of an **existing method** in openclacky (e.g. `WebSearch#execute` timeout, fix a bug in a built-in tool) | **Patch** | `clacky patch_new <id> "Const#method" -d "<desc>"` | `clacky patch_verify` |
| **Audit / block / observe** tool calls (block `rm -rf /`, log every shell command) — no Ruby needed | **Shell Hook** | `clacky hook_new <id> -e <event>` | `clacky hook_verify` |
| Plug openclacky into a **new IM platform** (Slack, in-house IM, custom webhook…) | **Channel Adapter** | `clacky channel_new <platform_id>` | `clacky channel_verify` |

## Authoritative documentation

Each mechanism has a full reference doc — read the relevant one with `web_fetch` before writing code:

- Patches → https://www.openclacky.com/docs/extend-patches
- Shell Hooks → https://www.openclacky.com/docs/extend-shell-hooks
- Channel Adapters → https://www.openclacky.com/docs/extend-channel-adapter

## Execution playbook

1. **Identify** which mechanism fits (use the table above; ask if genuinely ambiguous).
2. **Read the doc** for that mechanism with `web_fetch`. Don't guess fields, hook events, or required methods — the doc is the contract.
3. **Run the scaffold** CLI command. It generates the file(s) in `~/.clacky/...` with correct meta.
4. **Edit** the generated file to implement the user's intent. Keep generated meta fields (`target`, `event`, `platform_id`, the `Clacky::ChannelRegistry.register(...)` line, etc.) intact unless the doc says otherwise.
5. **Verify** with the matching `*_verify` command. Surface any `[FAIL]` lines to the user verbatim.

## When NOT to use this skill

- The user is building features in their own application that just *use* openclacky — that's normal coding, no patch/hook/channel needed.
- The user wants a brand-new tool/skill for *their* project — use `.clacky/skills/` or `.clacky/tools/`, not these gem-level mechanisms.
- The change can be made via `clacky config set ...` — prefer config over patches.
